/**
 * [ZBEX] This extension is in-line with the CIM working group for replacing the `protection` package, can be replaced when the working
 * group outcome is merged into the CIM model.
 *
 * A protective device used in power systems that measures the impedance of a transmission line to determine the distance to a fault, and initiates circuit
 * breaker tripping to isolate the faulty section and safeguard the power system.
 *
 * @property backwardBlind [ZBEX] The reverse blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
 * @property backwardReach [ZBEX] The reverse reach impedance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite
 * direction of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
 * @property backwardReactance [ZBEX] The reverse reactance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction
 * of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
 * @property forwardBlind [ZBEX] The forward blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
 * @property forwardReach [ZBEX] The forward reach impedance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite
 * direction of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
 * @property forwardReactance [ZBEX] The forward reactance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction
 * of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
 * @property operationPhaseAngle1 [ZBEX] The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 1 relay.
 * @property operationPhaseAngle2 [ZBEX] The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 2 relay.
 * @property operationPhaseAngle3 [ZBEX] The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 3 relay.
