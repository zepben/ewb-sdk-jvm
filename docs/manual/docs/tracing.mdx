Once you have a connected network model you can start following to connectivity to do some interesting analysis, from
simple tasks such as adding up cable lengths along a line to advanced functions like a full load flow analysis.

The Evolve SDK provides an API to make following connectivity (what we will call tracing) less cumbersome and more
productive. It provides a variety of use-case specific traces out of the box, but also a generic mechanism to write
your own traces in an easy to use manner. The
[Tracing](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-sdk-jvm/blob/main/src/main/java/com/zepben/cimbend/network/tracing/Tracing.java)
package is a great place to get an overview of the kind of tools we provide as part of the SDK.

## Basic Connectivity 

So, let's start at the absolute basic use case. "What is directly connected to this piece of equipment".
Obviously we provide a function to let you to find out. Let's see it in code:

TODO: Take example from datamodel page and code then explain in context of that

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
Breaker switch = network.get("aSwitch);
List<ConnectivityResult> connectivity = Tracing.connectedEquipment(switch, PhaseCode.ABCN);
connectivity.forEach(cr -> {
    println(String.format(
        "%s is connected to %s " +
        "via terminals %s -> ${it.toTerminal()} " +
        "through phases %s",
        it.from(),
        it.to(),
        it.fromTerminal(),
        it.toTerminal(),
        it.nominalPhasePaths().stream().map(path -> "${path.from()}:${path.to()}" }).collect(joining())
    ));
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val switch: Breaker = network.get("aSwitch)
val connectivity: List<ConnectivityResult> = Tracing.connectedEquipment(switch, PhaseCode.ABCN)
connectivity.forEach {
    println(
        "${it.from()} is connected to ${it.to()} " +
        "via terminals ${it.fromTerminal()} -> ${it.toTerminal()} " +
        """through phases ${it.nominalPhasePaths().map { path -> "${path.from()}:${path.to()}" }}"""
    )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Sometimes you want to be a bit more specific about your connectivity, such as what is connected only to one side of the
equipment. You can do this by using specific terminals:

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
Breaker switch = network.get("aSwitch);
List<ConnectivityResult> connectivity = Tracing.connectedTerminals(switch, PhaseCode.ABCN);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val switch: Breaker = network.get("aSwitch)
val connectivity: List<ConnectivityResult> = Tracing.connectedTerminals(switch, PhaseCode.ABCN)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will produce a subset of the result above, with just the equipment connected to the given terminal. The 
connectivity result instances in the subset will be exactly the same as the previous example.

## Tracing

### Basic Traversal

To trace a network, we obviously need to repeat the above process for each piece of equipment in the connectivity result
list. In computer science, stepping between nodes in a data structure like this is known as a traversal. Conveniently, 
the SDK provides a [Traversal](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-sdk-jvm/blob/main/src/main/java/com/zepben/traversals/Traversal.java) 
interface with a number of implementations also provided for different use cases.

The most common type you will use is the 
[BasicTraversal](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-sdk-jvm/blob/main/src/main/java/com/zepben/traversals/BasicTraversal.java).
In a nutshell, this class lets you easily specify how to step to connected objects, add custom actions to perform at
each step to an object, and conditions on which the tracing should stop. It has some more advanced features, such as 
allowing you to specify how to queue steps (for breadth, or depth or priority traversals) as well as custom tracking
of objects. See the code docs for more details.

There are a number of traces which we have identified as being frequently required. So, the SDK provides a number of 
preconfigured BasicTraversal creators for these common use cases. These can be found in the tracing package here:
https://github.com/zepben/evolve-sdk-jvm/blob/main/src/main/java/com/zepben/cimbend/network/tracing/Tracing.java

To get started, lets take a looks at the `Tracing.connectedEquipmentTrace()`. This returns a `BasicTraversal` that is
preconfigured to continously step to equipment that is connected in any way. Under the covers it uses the 
`Tracing.connectedEquipment` function we looked at above to continously step to connected objects. Now, say we wanted to
identify the nearest circuit breakers to a piece of equipment, capturing all equipment between those breakers. We can do
that with the following:

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
NetworkService network = new NetworkService();

// Populate network service with your network

AcLineSegment acLineSeg = network.get("my conductor", AcLineSegment.class);
if (acLineSeg == null) 
    return;

List<Breaker> breakers = new ArrayList<>();
List<ConductingEquipment> equipmentBetweenBreakers = ArrayList<>();
Tracing.connectedEquipmentTrace()
    .addStopCondition(equipment -> equipment instanceof Breaker)
    .addStepAction((equipment, isStopping) -> {
        if (equipment instanceof Breaker) {
            breakers.add((Breaker) equipment);
        } else if (!isStopping) {
            equipmentBetweenBreakers.add(equipment);
        }
    })
    .run(acLineSeg);

System.out.println("The closest circuit breakers are: " + breakers);
System.out.println("The equipment between the above breakers: " + equipmentBetweenBreakers);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val network = NetworkService()

// Populate network service with your network

val acLineSeg = network.get<AcLineSegment>("my conductor") ?: return

val breakers = mutableListOf<Breaker>()
val equipmentBetweenBreakers = mutableListOf<ConductingEquipment>()
Tracing.connectedEquipmentTrace()
    .addStopCondition { it is Breaker }
    .addStepAction { equipment, isStopping ->
        if (equipment is Breaker) {
            breakers.add(equipment)
        } else if (!isStopping) {
            equipmentBetweenBreakers.add(equipment)
        }
    }
    .run(acLineSeg)

println("The closest circuit breakers are: $breakers")
println("The equipment between the above breakers: $equipmentBetweenBreakers")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's break down what is happening with the trace:
- `addStopCondition` is returning true if the equipment at the current step is a `Breaker`. This will make the trace
  stop at the current step if the equipment is a breaker. Note that this will not terminate the trace, it simply stops
  any more traversing from the current step. That is, no more equipment will be queued to be stepped to from the equipment
  at this step. If there are other paths / branches in the trace in the queue, they will still be stepped to.
- `addStepAction` is capturing the equipment as a breaker if it is a breaker, otherwise it captures the equipment as 
   between breakers equipment if it is not stopping (as stopping happens on the breaker).

As you can see this provides an extremely simple but powerful way to perform useful traces over your network. 

### Useful traces

There are a number of traces that will be common between all networks. We have identified numerous of these and 
provide an easy way to instantiate them.

#### Set phases trace

`Tracing.setPhases()` returns a `SetPhases` instance. This provides a way to dynamically set phases at runtime based
on a network's energy sources and the nominal phase connectivity within the network.

#### Phase traces 

There are numerous traces to trace based on various types of phasing data. These traces will ignore 
- `Tracing.phaseTrace()` will trace based on nominal phase connectivity, ignoring open switches or in service flags.
- `Tracing.normalPhaseTrace()` will trace based on nominal phase connectivity, stopping at normally open switches or 
  equipment flagged as not normally in service. 
- `Tracing.currentPhaseTrace()` will trace based on nominal phase connectivity, stopping at currently open switches or 
  equipment flagged as not currently in service. 

#### Downstream / Upstream traces 

There are traces configured to find all upstream or downstream equipment from any piece of equipment that is on a feeder:
- `Tracing.normalDownstreamTrace()` will trace downstream of the start equipment based on the normal state of the network.
- `Tracing.currentDownstreamTrace()` will trace downstream of the start equipment based on the current state of the network.
- `Tracing.normalUpstreamTrace()` will trace upstream of the start equipment based on the normal state of the network.
- `Tracing.currentUpstreamTrace()` will trace upstream of the start equipment based on the current state of the network.

#### Other traces

There are other useful but less common traces available. See the 
[code](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-sdk-jvm/blob/main/src/main/java/com/zepben/cimbend/network/tracing/Tracing.java)
for all the available traces.
