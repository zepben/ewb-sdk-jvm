/**
 * A rotating machine which may be used as a generator or motor.
 *
 * @property ratedPowerFactor Power factor (nameplate data). It is primarily used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
 *                            The attribute cannot be a negative value.
 * @property ratedS Nameplate apparent power rating for the unit in volt-amperes (VA). The attribute shall have a positive value.
 * @property ratedU Rated voltage in volts (nameplate data, Ur in IEC 60909-0). It is primarily used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
 *                  The attribute shall be a positive value.
 * @property p Active power injection in watts. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
 *             Starting value for a steady state solution.
 * @property q Reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
 *             Starting value for a steady state solution.
