 * A Clamp is a galvanic connection at a line segment where other equipment is connected. A Clamp does not cut the line segment. A Clamp is ConductingEquipment

 * @property lengthFromTerminal1 The length to the place where the clamp is located starting from side one of the line segment, i.e. the line segment terminal
 * with sequence number equal to 1.
 * @property acLineSegment The line segment to which the clamp is connected.
