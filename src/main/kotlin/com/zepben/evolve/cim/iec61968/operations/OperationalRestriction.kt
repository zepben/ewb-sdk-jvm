 * A document that can be associated with equipment to describe any sort of restrictions compared with the

 * temporary maximum loadings, maximum switching current, do not operate if bus couplers are open, etc.
 *
 *
 * In the UK, for example, if a breaker or switch ever mal-operates, this is reported centrally and utilities
 * use their asset systems to identify all the installed devices of the same manufacturer's type.
 * They then apply operational restrictions in the operational systems to warn operators of potential problems.
 * After appropriate inspection and maintenance, the operational restrictions may be removed.
