/**
 * A generic device designed to close, or open, or both, one or more electric circuits.  All switches are two terminal devices including grounding switches.
 *
 * NOTE: The normal and currently open properties are implemented as an integer rather than a boolean to allow for the caching of
 *       measurement values if the switch is operating un-ganged. These values will cache the latest values from the measurement
 *       value for each phase of the switch.
 *
 * @property ratedCurrent The maximum continuous current carrying capacity in amps governed by the device material and construction.
 *                        The attribute shall be a positive value.
 * @property normalOpen The attribute is used in cases when no Measurement for the status value is present. If the Switch has a status measurement
 *                      the Discrete.normalValue is expected to match with the Switch.normalOpen.
 * @property open The attribute tells if the switch is considered open when used as input to topology processing.
 * @property assetInfo Datasheet information for this Switch.
