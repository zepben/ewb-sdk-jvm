/**
 * A generic equivalent for an energy supplier on a transmission or distribution voltage level.
 *
 * @property voltageAngle Phase angle of a-phase open circuit used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated with
 *                        the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input to
 *                        the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
 * @property voltageMagnitude Phase-to-phase open circuit voltage magnitude used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node
 *                            associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level
 *                            are used as input to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
 * @property pMax This is the maximum active power that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a
 *                TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
 * @property pMin This is the minimum active power that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a
 *                TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
 * @property r Positive sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property r0 Zero sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property rn Negative sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property x Positive sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property x0 Zero sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property xn Negative sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property isExternalGrid True if this energy source represents the higher-level power grid connection to an external grid that normally is modelled as the
 *                          slack bus for power flow calculations.
 * @property rMin Minimum positive sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property rnMin Minimum negative sequence Thevenin resistance
 * @property r0Min Minimum zero sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property xMin Minimum positive sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property xnMin Minimum negative sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property x0Min Minimum zero sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property rMax Maximum positive sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property rnMax Maximum negative sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property r0Max Maximum zero sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property xMax Maximum positive sequence Thevenin reactance.
 * @property xnMax Maximum negative sequence Thevenin resistance.
 * @property x0Max Maximum zero sequence Thevenin reactance.
