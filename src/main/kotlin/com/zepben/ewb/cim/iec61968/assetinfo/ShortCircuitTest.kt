/**
 * Short-circuit test results determine mesh impedance parameters. They include load losses and leakage impedances. For three-phase windings, the excitation
 * can be a positive sequence (the default) or a zero sequence. There shall be at least one grounded winding.
 *
 * @property current Short circuit current in amps.
 * @property energisedEndStep Tap step number for the energised end of the test pair.
 * @property groundedEndStep Tap step number for the grounded end of the test pair.
 * @property leakageImpedance Leakage impedance measured from a positive-sequence or single-phase short-circuit test in ohms.
 * @property leakageImpedanceZero Leakage impedance measured from a zero-sequence short-circuit test in ohms.
 * @property loss Load losses from a positive-sequence or single-phase short-circuit test in watts.
 * @property lossZero Load losses from a zero-sequence short-circuit test in watts.
 * @property power Short circuit apparent power in VA.
 * @property voltage Short circuit voltage as a percentage.
 * @property voltageOhmicPart Short Circuit Voltage â€“ Ohmic Part as a percentage.
