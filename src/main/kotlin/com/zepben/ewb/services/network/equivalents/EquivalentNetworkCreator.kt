/**
 * Utility class that contains methods to add 'equivalent networks' to the edges between [EquipmentContainer]s. The 'equivalent networks' are network
 * simplifications comprised of groups of [EquivalentBranch]es with [ConductingEquipment].
 *
 * Use cases examples:
 * - Adding [EnergyConsumer]s to the edge between a [Feeder] and its [LvFeeder]s. Essentially simplifying the lv side.
 * - Adding [EnergySource]s to the edge between a [Feeder] and its [Substation]. Essentially simplifying the feeders upstream network.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * For the purpose of these functions, we are only interested in [EquipmentContainer]s that divide the network into different levels of voltage e.g.
 * [LvFeeder], [Feeder], [Substation], [Circuit]. As such we filter out [Site]s whenever trying to determine edges.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * This class' methods identify a [ConductingEquipment] as an edge equipment if it belongs to two neighbouring [EquipmentContainer]s. If they find a
 * [ConnectivityNode] associated with a [Terminal] belonging to a [ConductingEquipment] that was identified as an edge equipment, they will treat it as an edge
 * and attach an [EquivalentBranch] to it.
