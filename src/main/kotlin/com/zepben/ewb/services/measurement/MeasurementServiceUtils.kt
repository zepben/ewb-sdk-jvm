/**
 * A function that provides an exhaustive `when` style statement for all [MeasurementValue] leaf types supported by
 * the [MeasurementService]. If the provided [MeasurementValue] is not supported by the service the [isOther] handler
 * is invoked which by default will throw an [IllegalArgumentException]
 *
 * By using this function, you acknowledge that if any new types are added to the measurement service, and thus this
 * function, it will cause a compilation error when updating to the new version. This should reduce errors due to
 * missed handling of new types introduced to the model. As this is intended behaviour it generally will not be
 * considered a breaking change in terms of semantic versioning of this library.
 *
 * If it is not critical that all types within the service are always handled, it is recommended to use a typical
 * `when` statement (Kotlin) or if-else branch (Java) and update new cases as required without breaking your code.
 *
 * @param measurementValue The measurement value object to handle.
 * @param isAnalogValue Handler when the [MeasurementValue] is a [AnalogValue]
 * @param isAccumulatorValue Handler when the [MeasurementValue] is a [AccumulatorValue]
 * @param isDiscreteValue Handler when the [MeasurementValue] is a [DiscreteValue]
 * @param isOther Handler when the [MeasurementValue] is not supported by the [MeasurementService].
