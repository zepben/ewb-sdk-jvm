/**
 * A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground which is typically used to compensate earth faults. An earth fault compensator device
 * modelled with a single terminal implies a second terminal solidly connected to ground. If two terminals are modelled, the ground is not assumed and
 * normal connection rules apply.
 *
 * @property r Nominal resistance of device in ohms.
