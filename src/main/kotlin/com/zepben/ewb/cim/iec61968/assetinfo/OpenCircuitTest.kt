/**
 * Open-circuit test results verify winding turn ratios and phase shifts. They include induced voltage and phase shift measurements on open-circuit windings,
 * with voltage applied to the energised end. For three-phase windings, the excitation can be a positive sequence (the default) or a zero sequence.
 *
 * @property energisedEndStep Tap step number for the energised end of the test pair.
 * @property energisedEndVoltage Voltage applied to the winding (end) during test in volts.
 * @property openEndStep Tap step number for the open end of the test pair.
 * @property openEndVoltage Voltage measured at the open-circuited end, with the energised end set to rated voltage and all other ends open in volts.
 * @property phaseShift Phase shift measured at the open end with the energised end set to rated voltage and all other ends open in angle degrees.
