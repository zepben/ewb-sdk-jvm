/**
 * No-load test results determine core admittance parameters. They include exciting current and core loss measurements from applying voltage to one
 * winding. The excitation may be positive sequence or zero sequence. The test may be repeated at different voltages to measure saturation.
 *
 * @property energisedEndVoltage Voltage applied to the winding (end) during test in volts.
 * @property excitingCurrent Exciting current measured from a positive-sequence or single-phase excitation test as a percentage.
 * @property excitingCurrentZero Exciting current measured from a zero-sequence open-circuit excitation test as a percentage.
 * @property loss Losses measured from a positive-sequence or single-phase excitation test in watts.
 * @property lossZero Losses measured from a zero-sequence excitation test in watts.
