 * by the associated communication function(s). An end device may be owned by a consumer, a service provider, utility or otherwise.
 *
 * There may be a related end device function that identifies a sensor or control point within a metering application or

 *
 * Some devices may use an optical port that conforms to the ANSI C12.18 standard for communications.
