/**
 * Mechanism for changing transformer winding tap positions.
 *
 * @property controlEnabled Specifies the regulation status of the equipment.  True is regulating, false is not regulating.
 * @property tapChangerControl The regulating control scheme in which this tap changer participates.
 * @property highStep Highest possible tap step position, advance from neutral. The attribute shall be greater than lowStep. This tap position results in the
 *                    maximum voltage boost on secondary winding(s).
 * @property lowStep Lowest possible tap step position, retard from neutral. This tap position results in the maximum voltage buck on secondary winding(s).
 * @property neutralStep The neutral tap step position for this winding.
 *                       The attribute shall be equal or greater than lowStep and equal or less than highStep.
 * @property neutralU Voltage at which the winding operates at the neutral tap setting.
 * @property normalStep The tap step position used in "normal" network operation for this winding. For a "Fixed" tap changer indicates the current physical tap setting.
 *                      The attribute shall be equal or greater than lowStep and equal or less than highStep.
 * @property step Tap changer position.
 *                Starting step for a steady state solution. Non integer values are allowed to support continuous tap variables.
 *                The reasons for continuous value are to support study cases where no discrete tap changers has yet been designed,
 *                a solutions where a narrow voltage band force the tap step to oscillate or accommodate for a continuous solution as input.
 *                The attribute shall be equal or greater than lowStep and equal or less than highStep.
