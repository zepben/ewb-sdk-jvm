/**
 * A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power.The SVC typically consists of a step-down transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor,
 * and thyristor-switched capacitor arms. The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode. When in voltage control mode, the output of
 * the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the controlled bus from the voltage set-point. The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.
 * If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage set-point, the SVC MVar output is zero.
 *
 * @property capacitiveRating Capacitive reactance in Ohms at maximum capacitive reactive power. Shall always be positive.
 * @property inductiveRating Inductive reactance in Ohms at maximum inductive reactive power. Shall always be negative.
 * @property q Reactive power injection in VAr. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting value for a steady state solution.
 * @property svcControlMode SVC control mode.
 * @property voltageSetPoint The reactive power output of the SVC is proportional to the difference between the voltage at the regulated bus and the voltage set-point.
 *                           When the regulated bus voltage is equal to the voltage set-point, the reactive power output is zero. Must be in volts.
