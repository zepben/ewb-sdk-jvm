 * A Series Compensator is a series capacitor or reactor or an AC transmission line without charging susceptance. It is a two terminal device.
 *
 * @property r Positive sequence resistance in ohms.
 * @property r0 Zero sequence resistance in ohms.
 * @property x Positive sequence reactance in ohms.
 * @property x0 Zero sequence reactance in ohms.
 * @property varistorRatedCurrent The maximum current in amps the varistor is designed to handle at specified duration. It is used for short circuit
 *                                calculations. The attribute shall be a positive value. If null and varistorVoltageThreshold is null, a varistor is not
 *                                present.
 * @property varistorVoltageThreshold The dc voltage in volts at which the varistor starts conducting. It is used for short circuit calculations. If null and
 *                                    varistorRatedCurrent is null, a varistor is not present.
