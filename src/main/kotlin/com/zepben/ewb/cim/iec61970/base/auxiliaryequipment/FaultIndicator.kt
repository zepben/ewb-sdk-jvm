 * A FaultIndicator is typically only an indicator (which may or may not be remotely monitored), and not a piece of equipment
 * that actually initiates a protection event. It is used for FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation and Restoration) purposes,
 * assisting with the dispatch of crews to "most likely" part of the network (i.e. assists with determining circuit section
 * where the fault most likely happened).
