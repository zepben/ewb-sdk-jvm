 * Fraction specified explicitly with a numerator and denominator, which can be used to calculate the quotient.

 * @property quotient The result of dividing the numerator by the denominator. This is lazily evaluated and throws an [IllegalArgumentException]
 *                    upon evaluation if the denominator is zero.
