/**
 * A wire or combination of wires, with consistent electrical characteristics, building a single electrical system, used to carry alternating current
 * between points in the power system.
 *
 * For symmetrical, transposed 3ph lines, it is sufficient to use  attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the
 * entire length of the segment. Additionally, impedances can be computed by using length and associated per length impedances.
 *
 * The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines  may have
 * slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and  variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.
 *
 * @property perLengthSequenceImpedance Per-length impedance of this line segment.
