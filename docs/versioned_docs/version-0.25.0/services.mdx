Now that you are able to create a data model, you need something to manage the objects.
This is where we provide a set of classes, which we call services, to do this.

The services basically act as a container for your model. However, they provide some features which make it much nicer
to use than a typical map / dictionary type data container to store your identified objects. The SDK provides the
following services

* NetworkService
* CustomerService
* DiagramService

Each of these services manage a specific subset of identified objects. This subset will hopefully be somewhat obvious
based on the name of each service. If you would like to know why there a multiple services for different object types
you can read more about it [here](#why-multiple-services).

## Common Service functionality

Because services work with [identified objects](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/cim100/TC57CIM/IEC61970/Base/Core/IdentifiedObject)
they can provide some common level of functionality. This functionality can be found in the base class `BaseService`.

### Adding and Removing Objects

As the different services support different subsets of identified objects, you can only add objects directly to a concrete
service reference. However, sometimes you wish to write some code that works with a set of different objects that are all supported
by the one service. For example, you might have some code that works only on `ConductingEquipment` and you want to add or remove
these objects. Instead of having to cast to their derived type just to add/remove, `tryAdd` and `tryRemove` functions
are provided that accept any identified object. These functions will do the grunt work and call the appropriate concrete
add/remove functions on the service. If the service does not support the provided identified object an exception is thrown.

// If you don't have a reference to a leaf type, you can use the tryAdd function.
// However this will throw if the service doesn't support the object type.
IdentifiedObject idObjRef = new Junction();
service.tryAdd(idObjRef);
```

</TabItem>

val service = NetworkService()

val breaker = Breaker()

// If you don't have a reference to a leaf type, you can use the tryAdd function.
// However this will throw if the service doesn't support the object type.
val idObjRef: IdentifiedObject = Junction()
service.tryAdd(idObjRef)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Object Retrieval

There are a few ways we provide to get objects back out of a service. The most obvious one is by mRID:

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
NetworkService service = NetworkService();
service.add(new Breaker("breaker1"));
Breaker breaker = service.get("breaker1", Breaker.class)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val service = NetworkService()
service.add(Breaker("breaker1"))
val breaker = service.get<Breaker>("breaker1")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also get collections of objects back out of the service. The power here is you can get objects from anywhere
in the CIM class hierarchy. Due to the internal data structures used by the services, using these functions is more
efficient than looping over all objects in the service and checking if they are of the required type.

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
NetworkService service = new NetworkService()

service.add(new Breaker())
service.add(new Junction())

// All the following will contain both the breaker and the junction added to the service.
service.sequenceOf(ConductingEquipment.class)
service.listOf(ConductingEquipment.class)
service.setOf(ConductingEquipment.class)

// This creates a map of mRID to the Identified Object
service.mapOf(ConductingEquipment.class)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val service = NetworkService()

service.add(Breaker())
service.add(Junction())

// All the following will contain both the breaker and the junction added to the service.
service.sequenceOf<ConductingEquipment>()
service.listOf<ConductingEquipment>()
service.setOf<ConductingEquipment>()

// This creates a map of mRID to the Identified Object
service.mapOf<ConductingEquipment>()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Network Service

The network service works with objects related to the physical asset model. That means all
[PowerSystemResource](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/Core/PowerSystemResource) types, but also
data related types such as [AssetInfo](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Assets/AssetInfo) and
[Location](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Common/Location).

The network service also generates an index between power system resources and terminals and their corresponding
measurements. When you add a [Measurement](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/Meas/Measurement)
to the service, it indexes it against the `powerSystemResourceMRID` or the `terminalMRID` associated with the measurement.
You can then get all measurements associated with a power system resource or a terminal via its mRID via the lookup on
the service:

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
NetworkService service = NetworkService();

Analog amps = new Analog();
amps.setPowerSystemResourceMRID("ASWITCH");

Accumulator count = Accumulator();
count.setPowerSystemResourceMRID("ASWITCH");

service.add(amps);
service.add(count);

// Gets both the analog and the accumulator
service.getMeasurements("ASWITCH", Measurement.class);

// Will get just the analog
service.getMeasurements("ASWITCH", Analog.class);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val service = NetworkService()

val amps = Analog().apply { powerSystemResourceMRID = "ASWITCH" }
val count = Accumulator().apply { powerSystemResourceMRID = "ASWITCH" }

service.add(amps)
service.add(count)

// Gets both the analog and the accumulator
service.getMeasurements<Measurement>("ASWITCH")

// Will get just the analog
service.getMeasurements<Analog>("ASWITCH")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note if you change the `powerSystemResourceMRID` or `terminalMRID` set on the measurement after it has been added to the
service, it is not re-indexed automatically. Currently you need to to remove the measurement and re-add it to the service.
However this should rarely be an issue as a measurement is unlikely to ever change the device it is measuring, so as long
as the association is set before adding to the service it is unlikely to be a problem.

## Customer Service

The customer service works with objects related to customers and their agreements they may have with actors in the
network. At this point in time it provides no further specialised functionality.

## Diagram Service

The diagram service works with objects related to diagrams associated with identified objects.
It also provides a lookup to be able to get the
[DiagramObjects](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/DiagramObject) associated with any
identified object. Specifically:
- If the mRID is a diagram object, a list with just the diagram object is returned.
- If the mRID is a [Diagram](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/Diagram) all diagram
  objects belonging to that diagram are returned.
- If the mRID is any other identified object, the diagram objects for that identified object are returned.

        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
DiagramService service = new DiagramService();

Diagram aDiagram = new Diagram();

DiagramObject do1 = DiagramObject();
do1.setDiagram(aDiagram);
do1.identifiedObjectMRID = "aSwitch";
aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this);

DiagramObject do2 = DiagramObject();
do2.setDiagram(aDiagram);
do2.identifiedObjectMRID = "aSwitch";
aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this);

DiagramObject do3 = DiagramObject();
do3.setDiagram(aDiagram);
do3.identifiedObjectMRID = "aSwitch";
aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this);

service.add(do1)
service.add(do2)
service.add(do3)

// Contains [do1]
service.getDiagramObjects(do1.mRID)

// Contains [do1, do2, do3]
service.getDiagramObjects(aDiagram.mRID)

// Contains [do1, do2]
service.getDiagramObjects("aSwitch")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val service = DiagramService()

val aDiagram = Diagram()

val do1 = DiagramObject().apply {
    diagram = aDiagram
    identifiedObjectMRID = "aSwitch"
    aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this)
}

val do2 = DiagramObject().apply {
    diagram = aDiagram
    identifiedObjectMRID = "aSwitch"
    aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this)
}

val do3 = DiagramObject().apply {
    diagram = aDiagram
    aDiagram.addDiagramObject(this)
}

service.add(do1)
service.add(do2)
service.add(do3)

// Contains [do1]
service.getDiagramObjects(do1.mRID)

// Contains [do1, do2, do3]
service.getDiagramObjects(aDiagram.mRID)

// Contains [do1, do2]
service.getDiagramObjects("aSwitch")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This works by indexing the `identifiedObjectMRID` when the diagram object is added to the service. Note however,
that setting the `identifiedObjectMRID` after the diagram object is added will not cause it to be re-indexed automatically.
Currently you need to to remove the diagram object and re-add it to the service.
This should rarely be an issue however, as a diagram object is unlikely to ever change the identified object it is
representing, so as long as it is set before adding it to the service it is unlikely to be a problem.

## Deferred References

When creating an object to include in the model, you will often not have all referenced objects constructed, not have
all the information to construct a reference immediately, or not have a reference handy to use. However, you will 
generally have the mRID of any referenced objects. To deal with this, the services provide a `resolveOrDeferReference` 
function. This function will:
- Resolve a reference immediately (in both directions if applicable) if the reference mRID object is already added to the service. 
- If the reference mRID is not added to the service, the request to resolve the reference is cached. When an object 
  with the referenced mRID is eventually added to the service, the reference is resolved at this time. 

Unresolved references can also be queried back out of the service. Let's see it all with a simple example:

<Tabs
    groupId="code-example"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        { label: "Java", value: "java", },
        { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
NetworkService service = new NetworkService();

Feeder feeder = new Feeder("f");
service.add(feeder)

Breaker switch = new Breaker("b1");
service.add(switch);

// As the switch is already added to the service, this will be resolved immediately.
service.resolveOrDeferReference(Resolvers.equipment(feeder), switch.getMRID());
System.out.println(feeder.getEquipment().contains(switch)); // true

// Now if we try and resolve something not added it will be deferred
Junction junction = new Junction("j1");
service.resolveOrDeferReference(Resolvers.equipment(feeder), junction.getMRID());
System.out.println(feeder.getEquipment().contains(junction)); // false

// We can query the unresolved reference mRIDs back out of the service
System.out.println(service.getUnresolvedReferenceMrids(Resolvers.equipment(feeder))); // ["j1"]
// Or using the mrid of the destination object
System.out.println(service.getUnresolvedReferencesTo(feeder.mrid)) // [UnresolvedReference(junction, toMrid="f")]
// Or using the mrid of the source object
System.out.println(service.getUnresolvedReferencesFrom(junction.mrid)) // [UnresolvedReference(feeder, toMrid="j1")]

// When the object with the deferred mRID is added, the reference gets resolved
service.add(junction)
System.out.println(feeder.getEquipment().contains(junction)) // true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem  value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val service = NetworkService()

val feeder = Feeder("f")

val switch = Breaker("b1")

service.resolveOrDeferReference(Resolvers.equipment(feeder), switch.mRID)
println(feeder.equipment.contains(switch)) // true

// Now if we try and resolve something not added it will be deferred
val junction = Junction("j1")
service.resolveOrDeferReference(Resolvers.equipment(feeder), junction.mRID)
println(feeder.equipment.contains(junction)) // false

// We can query the unresolved reference mRIDs back out of the service
println(service.getUnresolvedReferenceMrids(Resolvers.equipment(feeder))) // ["j1"]
// Or using the mrid of the destination object
println(service.getUnresolvedReferencesTo(feeder.mrid)) // [UnresolvedReference(junction, toMrid="f")]
// Or using the mrid of the source object
println(service.getUnresolvedReferencesFrom(junction.mrid)) // [UnresolvedReference(feeder, toMrid="j1")]

// When the object with the deferred mRID is added, the reference gets resolved
service.add(junction)
println(feeder.equipment.contains(junction)) // true
```

#### Why multiple services?

You might be asking "Why not just one service for all identified objects?". Admittedly, just having one would be easier
to work with. However, as models can become large, having every object in a single service (and thus process) will mean
you need an ever increasing amount of RAM in your system. What we have done is separated out parts of the
data model into separate concerns, at what we feel are sensible boundary points. That is:

* The network service deals with models of the physical electricity network.
* The customer service deals with customers and their agreements with electricity providers
(e.g their [Tariff](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Customers/Tariff)).
* The diagram service deals with things related to representing networks as diagrams
(see [Diagram](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/Diagram) and
 [DiagramObject](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/DiagramObject)).
* Once the platform supports measurement values, these values will be retrieved via a separate service rather than
  directly from measurement objects.

Ultimately there is a tradeoff between developer usability and model size feasibility. Hopefully you will find this
is a reasonable trade off when working with large systems.
