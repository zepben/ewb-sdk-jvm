/**
 * An AC electrical connection point to a piece of conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical connection points called connectivity nodes.
 *
 * @property conductingEquipment The conducting equipment of the terminal.  Conducting equipment have  terminals that may be connected to other
 *                               conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes or topological nodes.
 * @property phases Represents the normal network phasing condition.
 *                  If the attribute is missing three phases (ABC or ABCN) shall be assumed.
 * @property sequenceNumber The orientation of the terminal connections for a multiple terminal conducting equipment.
 *                          The sequence numbering starts with 1 and additional terminals should follow in increasing order.
 *                          The first terminal is the "starting point" for a two terminal branch.
 * @property normalFeederDirection Stores the direction of the feeder head relative to this [Terminal] in the normal state of the network.
 * @property currentFeederDirection Stores the direction of the feeder head relative to this [Terminal] in the current state of the network.
 * @property tracedPhases The phase object representing the traced phases in both the normal and current network. If
 *                        properly configured you would expect the normal state phases to match those in {@code phases}
